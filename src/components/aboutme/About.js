            <img src="./images/justin.PNG" alt="Me" width="150px" height="225px"></img>
            <p> I am an 19 year old student who is learning to become a full stack web developer where 
                I can create and maintain websites both on the front end, and back end. 
                I am currently unemployed so I could focus more on my schooling. I stream and play games 
                for fun. I have graduated from high school with honors at a 3.5 gpa. My skillset 
                includes python, javascript, css, html, react, express and a couple other libraries. </p>
